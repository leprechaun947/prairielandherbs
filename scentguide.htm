	<p class="eo"><span class="label">Cedarwood:</span> We use an organic cedarwood oil reclaimed from cedarwood trimmings - recycling! Cedarwood was perhaps the first plant used to make an essential oil; ancient Egyptians used it in their mummification rituals. It's antiseptic, fungicidal, purifying, and an excellent insect repellant (it has been used, along with citronella essential oil, to make a commercial insecticide). Cedarwood is sacred to Native Americans, and used very often in the spiritual and cleansing rituals of many people. Cedar is an excellent skin cleanser and helps combat acne, oily skin and scalp, and helps relieve dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, as well as dandruff. Also may be useful for arthritis and rheumatism.<br />
	Aromatherapeutically, cedarwood is very soothing and calming, easing nerves and mental tension. <em>Not to be used during pregnancy</em>. [EO]</p>
